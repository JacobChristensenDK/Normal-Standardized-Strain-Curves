# Normal-Standardized-Strain-Curves
This is the official repository related to the paper *Normal Standardized Strain Curves Stratified by Age and Sex in Healthy Individuals: The Copenhagen City Heart Study* by Christensen and Simonsen et al. 

Here, we provide the age- and sex-appropriate reference ranges of the LV standardized longitudinal strain curves. In addition, we provide the official code implementations to standardize custom longitudinal strain curves and calculate EDS, LDS along with age- and sex-appropriate diastolic strain deviation as detailed in the paper.
