# Normal-Standardised-Strain-Curves
This is the official repository related to the paper *Normal Standardized Strain Curves Stratified by Age and Sex in Healthy Individuals: The Copenhagen City Heart Study* by Christensen and Simonsen et al. 

Here, we provide the age- and sex-appropriate reference ranges of the LV standardized longitudinal strain curves. In addition, we provide the official code implementations to standardize custom longitudinal strain curves and calculate age- and sex-appropriate diastolic strain deviation as detailed in the paper.
